deactivate

source venv/bin/activate

Question	                     Answer
(venv) showing in terminal	     ✅ Normal — it means your virtual environment is active. Keep it on while coding, deactivate when done.
fastf1_http_cache.sqlite file	 ✅ Created automatically by FastF1 for caching. Don’t touch it; it’s needed for faster re-runs.

fastf1.Cache.enable_cache('data/raw')
FastF1 created a cache system inside that folder to store downloaded race data locally.
That way, if you fetch Monaco 2023 again, it won’t re-download it from the web — it will use the local cache, which makes your code much faster.
